    A [Terraform] module for creating a public or private repository on [Github].

    **_This module supports Terraform v1.x and is compatible with the Official Terraform GitHub Provider v4.20 and above from `integrations/github`._**

    **Attention: This module is incompatible with the Hashicorp GitHub Provider! The latest version of this module supporting `hashicorp/github` provider is `~> 0.10.0`**

    ** Note: Versions 5.3.0, 5.4.0, and 5.5.0 of the Terraform Github Provider have broken branch protections support and should not be used.**

      [GitHub as Code][github-as-code] is a commercial solution built on top of
      our open-source Terraform modules for GitHub. It helps our customers to
      manage their GitHub organization more efficiently by enabling anyone in
      their organization to **self-service** manage **on- and offboarding of users**,
      **repositories**, and settings such as **branch protections**, **secrets**, and more
      through code. GitHub as Code comes with **pre-configured GitHub Actions
      pipelines** for **change pre-view in Pull Requests**, **fully automated
      rollouts** and **rollbacks**. It's a comprehensive, ready-to-use blueprint
      maintained by our team of platform engineering experts and saves
      companies such as yours tons of time by building on top of a pre-configured
      solution instead of building and maintaining it yourself.
